            I am Adithyan.I attend the Government Engineering College in Idukki to study the field of computer science. SinceÂ I haven't started concentrating on a specific talent, I'm not sure what to say in my introduction. I'mÂ just an inquisitive student trying things out!
              I started learning to code a little later than I should have because I was still studying biology science in high school.Â C was the first language ever learned, and then web development.Â I got bored after a while and started web scraping.Â days, I resemble a jack-of-all-trades, master-of-none.
